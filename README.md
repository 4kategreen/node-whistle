node-whistle
======================

[Whistle](www.whistle.com) is like a fitbit for dogs... I did some investigating and discovered some of their API calls and made my own node module to make use of them.

See [Whistle-Unofficial-API](https://github.com/oehokie/Whistle-Unofficial-API) for a use example.  The code is pretty straight-forward otherwise.
